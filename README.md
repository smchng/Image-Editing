# Image-Editing
An image processor programmed with Python which manipulates the pixels within the image.
Once an image is imported, for example the cat, you are able to apply filters and distort the image 
depending on the command given in. The effects are applied through editing the values of each pixel. Therefore, a higher quality image may take 
longer to process. The main.py file is used to create the user interface and apply commands that are inputted. While the other .py files are filled 
with functions that manipulate the pixels.
Use the number keys on the keyboard to apply image changes.
